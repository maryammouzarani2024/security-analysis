new pathgrind, Guided Heap Corruption Detecting Fuzzer

=========
This is a revision of pathgrind at https://github.com/dpc-grindland/Fuzzgrind. 
In the new version a static analysis is first performed to locate heap operations, calculate the (static) size of heap buffers and then, pathgrid is used to fuzz the execution paths containing these operations and calculates the path and vulnerability constraints and create appropriate input data to test the vulnerability.  

More details are available in the article "A smart fuzzing method for detecting heap-based vulnerabilities in executable codes" at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sec.1681 .

Requirements
------------
- bzip2
- autoconf
- make
- gcc
- python
- gawk
- 32 bit libraries for ubuntu (sudo apt-get install ia32-libs)
- 32 bit c library for building c programs for testing with pathgrind (sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386)

On ubuntu you can install the dependencies using apt-get, e.g. `sudo apt-get install autoconf`

Installation
------------
$ ./install.sh

Configuration
-------------
Configuration file: fuzz/settings.cfg

Execution
---------
CLI: $ ./fuzz/fuzz.py

GUI: $ ./fuzz/gui.py

Example
-------
$ ./fuzz/fuzz.py test6
  
New input are created in testcase/input/

Crash files are be saved in testcase/crash/

You can also read a fairly detailed tutorial on Pathgrind at the [SRC:CLR blog](https://blog.sourceclear.com/dynamic-symbolic-execution-with-pathgrind/)
