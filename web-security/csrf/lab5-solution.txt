Lab #5: CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie

Target: change the viewer's email address


This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. 
It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't fully integrated into the site's session handling system.

Hint: 
   
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Analysis:

  CSRF attack could be possible, when:
    - There is a relevant action
    - There is cookie-based session handling
    - No unpredictable request parameter is required

  test1: change csrf -> invalid csrf value
  test2: remove csrf-> missing csrf
  test3: change request to get -> not working
 

 In this page there is session and csrfkey in the cookie, and maybe there are two different systems that handle session mgmt and csrf prevention.
 Testing csrf token and key:
    - check if they are tied togethere:
        1- submit an invalid csrf token
        2- submit a valid csrf token from another user
        3- submit a valid csrf token and csrf key cookie
            

            csrf token: fsiXJULeGOdYo4R6M12G1JTUmwcjDp7q
            csrf key: oc2QSdYJprMIQMfEOUdv7IW7jMicHept


            and it works!
            now its time to generate the attack script

            we must:
            1- inject cerf key in the victime headers (http header injection)
                in the home page searching a word, results in setting a cookie named LastSearchTerm
                so we can inject %0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20csrfKey=ATTACKER-CSRFKEY


            2- send the csrf attack script containing the csrf token to the victim
