Lab #1:  CSRF vulnerability with no defenses


Target: change the viewer's email address


This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.

Hint: 
   
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Analysis:

  The change email page is vulnerable to csrf.
