Lab #6:CSRF where token is duplicated in cookie
Target: change the viewer's email address


This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. 
It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't fully integrated into the site's session handling system.

Hint: 
   
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Analysis:

  CSRF attack could be possible, when:
    - There is a relevant action
    - There is cookie-based session handling
    - No unpredictable request parameter is required

  test1: change csrf -> invalid csrf value
  test2: remove csrf-> missing csrf
  test3: change request to get -> not working
 

 In this page there is session and csrfkey in the cookie, and maybe there are two different systems that handle session mgmt and csrf prevention.
 Testing csrf token and key:
    - check if they are tied togethere:
        1- submit an invalid csrf token
        2- submit a valid csrf token from another user
        3- submit a valid csrf token and csrf key cookie
            

            The attack is similar to lab5 with the same csrfkey and value.
