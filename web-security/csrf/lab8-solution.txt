Lab #8:SameSite Strict bypass via client-side redirect

Target: change the viewer's email address


This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. 
It does not use any csrf token, but applies samesite=strict restriction to the session cookie.


Analysis:

  CSRF attack could be possible, when:
    - There is a relevant action
    - There is cookie-based session handling
    - No unpredictable request parameter is required

  There is no csrf token in  the request, but the cookie setting does not allow the post request in the attack script to work. 
 
  Check the response of login post request to find the samesite=strict setting.

  Then, search for a redirection possibility:
  In posting a comment there is an automated redirection to the post after confirmation of the comment:
  /post/comment/confirmation?postId=11

it is possible to load my-account page using this redirection:

/post/comment/confirmation?postId=../../../my-account

So, here we go:
 <script>
            document.location = "https://myPOrtSwiggerID.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=../../../my-account/change-email?email=pwned@web-security-academy.net%26submit=1";
   </script>
