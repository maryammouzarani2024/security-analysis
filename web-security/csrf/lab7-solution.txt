Lab #7:  SameSite Lax bypass via method override

Target: change the viewer's email address


This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. 
It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't fully integrated into the site's session handling system.

Hint: 
   
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Analysis:

  CSRF attack could be possible, when:
    - There is a relevant action
    - There is cookie-based session handling
    - No unpredictable request parameter is required

  There is no csrf token in  the request, but the cookie setting does not allow the post request in the attack script to work. 
  Lets test if it is possible to change the change_email request into get:

  changing the request to get at burpsuit does not help. But we can use get request and add _method=post to the request to decieve the browser:

<script>
    document.location = "https://myPOrtSwiggerID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email?email=pwned@web-security-academy.net&_method=POST";
</script>
