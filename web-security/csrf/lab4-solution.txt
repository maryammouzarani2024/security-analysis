Lab #4: CSRF where token is not tied to user session

Target: change the viewer's email address


This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren't integrated into the site's session handling system.
Hint: 
   
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Analysis:

  test1: change csrf -> invalid csrf value
  test2: remove csrf-> missing csrf
  test3: change request to get -> not working
  test4:    check if the tokens are bind to the ids:
            load the form and store the csrf token, login with another account and test the request with the first csrf token value.
