Lab #6: File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

Target: Get access to the content of /etc/passwd

Analysis:

The image files are loaded with Get request.

Challenge:  The application validates that the supplied filename ends with the expected file extension.

GET /image?filename=/var/www/image/72.jpg

send the request to the repeater and change the filename parameter as follows:


GET /image?filename=../../../etc/passwd%00.png

%00 is the null byte and says the server to ignore rest of the characters in the file path string.
