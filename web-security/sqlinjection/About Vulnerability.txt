What is SQL injection (SQLi)?

    SQL injection (SQLi) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. 
    This can allow an attacker to view data that they are not normally able to retrieve. 
    This might include data that belongs to other users, or any other data that the application can access. 
    In many cases, an attacker can modify or delete this data, causing persistent changes to the application's content or behavior.

    In some situations, an attacker can escalate a SQL injection attack to compromise the underlying server or other back-end infrastructure. 
    It can also enable them to perform denial-of-service attacks.

How to detect SQL injection vulnerabilities

    You can detect SQL injection manually using a systematic set of tests against every entry point in the application. 
    To do this, you would typically submit:

        - The single quote character ' and look for errors or other anomalies.
        - Some SQL-specific syntax that evaluates to the base (original) value of the entry point, and to a different value, and look for systematic differences in the application responses.
        - Boolean conditions such as OR 1=1 and OR 1=2, and look for differences in the application's responses.
        - Payloads designed to trigger time delays when executed within a SQL query, and look for differences in the time taken to respond.
        - OAST payloads designed to trigger an out-of-band network interaction when executed within a SQL query, and monitor any resulting interactions.
    
    Alternatively, you can find the majority of SQL injection vulnerabilities quickly and reliably using Burp Scanner.

SQL injection in different parts of the query
    Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query. Most experienced testers are familiar with this type of SQL injection.

    However, SQL injection vulnerabilities can occur at any location within the query, and within different query types. Some other common locations where SQL injection arises are:

        In UPDATE statements, within the updated values or the WHERE clause.
        In INSERT statements, within the inserted values.
        In SELECT statements, within the table or column name.
        In SELECT statements, within the ORDER BY clause.


Retrieving hidden data

    Imagine a shopping application that displays products in different categories. 
    When the user clicks on the Gifts category, their browser requests the URL:

        https://insecure-website.com/products?category=Gifts
    
    This causes the application to make a SQL query to retrieve details of the relevant products from the database:

        SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1
    
    This SQL query asks the database to return:

        all details (*)
        from the products table
        where the category is Gifts
        and released is 1.
    The restriction released = 1 is being used to hide products that are not released. 
    We could assume for unreleased products, released = 0.

Subverting application logic


    Imagine an application that lets users log in with a username and password. 
    If a user submits the username wiener and the password bluecheese, the application checks the credentials by performing the following SQL query:

            SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'

    If the query returns the details of a user, then the login is successful. 
    Otherwise, it is rejected.

    In this case, an attacker can log in as any user without the need for a password. 
    They can do this using the SQL comment sequence -- to remove the password check from the WHERE clause of the query. 
    For example, submitting the username administrator'-- and a blank password results in the following query:

     SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator'--' AND password = ''
    
    This query returns the user whose username is administrator and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.

SQL injection UNION attacks

    When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the UNION keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database. 
    This is commonly known as a SQL injection UNION attack.

    The UNION keyword enables you to execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. 
    For example:

        SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2
    
    This SQL query returns a single result set with two columns, containing values from columns a and b in table1 and columns c and d in table2.


    For a UNION query to work, two key requirements must be met:

       - The individual queries must return the same number of columns.
       - The data types in each column must be compatible between the individual queries.
    
    To carry out a SQL injection UNION attack, make sure that your attack meets these two requirements. 
    This normally involves finding out:

        - How many columns are being returned from the original query.
        - Which columns returned from the original query are of a suitable data type to hold the results from the injected query.
    


Determining the number of columns required
    
    When you perform a SQL injection UNION attack, there are two effective methods to determine how many columns are being returned from the original query.

    One method involves injecting a series of ORDER BY clauses and incrementing the specified column index until an error occurs. 
    For example, if the injection point is a quoted string within the WHERE clause of the original query, you would submit:

        ' ORDER BY 1--
        ' ORDER BY 2--
        ' ORDER BY 3--
        etc.
    This series of payloads modifies the original query to order the results by different columns in the result set. 
    The column in an ORDER BY clause can be specified by its index, so you don't need to know the names of any columns. 
    When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error, such as:

        The ORDER BY position number 3 is out of range of the number of items in the select list.
    The application might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but it may also issue a generic error response. 
    In other cases, it may simply return no results at all. 
    Either way, as long as you can detect some difference in the response, you can infer how many columns are being returned from the query.


    The second method involves submitting a series of UNION SELECT payloads specifying a different number of null values:

        ' UNION SELECT NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--
        etc.
    If the number of nulls does not match the number of columns, the database returns an error, such as:

    All queries combined using a UNION, INTERSECT or EXCEPT operator must have an equal number of expressions in their target lists.
    We use NULL as the values returned from the injected SELECT query because the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injected queries. 
    NULL is convertible to every common data type, so it maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct.

    As with the ORDER BY technique, the application might actually return the database error in its HTTP response, but may return a generic error or simply return no results. 
    When the number of nulls matches the number of columns, the database returns an additional row in the result set, containing null values in each column. 
    The effect on the HTTP response depends on the application's code. 
    If you are lucky, you will see some additional content within the response, such as an extra row on an HTML table.
    Otherwise, the null values might trigger a different error, such as a NullPointerException. 
    In the worst case, the response might look the same as a response caused by an incorrect number of nulls. 
    This would make this method ineffective.

Database-specific syntax

    On Oracle, every SELECT query must use the FROM keyword and specify a valid table. 
    There is a built-in table on Oracle called dual which can be used for this purpose. 
    So the injected queries on Oracle would need to look like:

         ' UNION SELECT NULL FROM DUAL--
    
    The payloads described use the double-dash comment sequence -- to comment out the remainder of the original query following the injection point. 
    On MySQL, the double-dash sequence must be followed by a space. 
    Alternatively, the hash character # can be used to identify a comment.

    For more details of database-specific syntax, see the SQL injection cheat sheet.


Finding columns with a useful data type

    A SQL injection UNION attack enables you to retrieve the results from an injected query. 
    The interesting data that you want to retrieve is normally in string form. 
    This means you need to find one or more columns in the original query results whose data type is, or is compatible with, string data.

    After you determine the number of required columns, you can probe each column to test whether it can hold string data. 
    You can submit a series of UNION SELECT payloads that place a string value into each column in turn. 
    For example, if the query returns four columns, you would submit:

        ' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--
        ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL,'a'--
    
    If the column data type is not compatible with string data, the injected query will cause a database error, such as:

        Conversion failed when converting the varchar value 'a' to data type int.

    If an error does not occur, and the application's response contains some additional content including the injected string value, then the relevant column is suitable for retrieving string data.
    sample: lab4-solution.txt


Using a SQL injection UNION attack to retrieve interesting data

    When you have determined the number of columns returned by the original query and found which columns can hold string data, you are in a position to retrieve interesting data.

    Suppose that:

    The original query returns two columns, both of which can hold string data.
    The injection point is a quoted string within the WHERE clause.
    The database contains a table called users with the columns username and password.
    In this example, you can retrieve the contents of the users table by submitting the input:

        ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
    In order to perform this attack, you need to know that there is a table called users with two columns called username and password. 
    Without this information, you would have to guess the names of the tables and columns. 
    All modern databases provide ways to examine the database structure, and determine what tables and columns they contain.

Retrieving multiple values within a single column


    In some cases the query in the previous example may only return a single column.

    You can retrieve multiple values together within this single column by concatenating the values together. 
    You can include a separator to let you distinguish the combined values. 
    For example, on Oracle you could submit the input:

     ' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
    This uses the double-pipe sequence || which is a string concatenation operator on Oracle. 
    The injected query concatenates together the values of the username and password fields, separated by the ~ character.

    The results from the query contain all the usernames and passwords, for example:

        ...
        administrator~s3cure
        wiener~peter
        carlos~montoya
        ...
    Different databases use different syntax to perform string concatenation.

Examining the database in SQL injection attacks

    To exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities, it's often necessary to find information about the database. 
    This includes:

        The type and version of the database software.
        The tables and columns that the database contains.

Querying the database type and version

    You can potentially identify both the database type and version by injecting provider-specific queries to see if one works

    The following are some queries to determine the database version for some popular database types:

        Database type	Query
        Microsoft, MySQL	SELECT @@version
        Oracle	SELECT * FROM v$version
        PostgreSQL	SELECT version()
    
    For example, you could use a UNION attack with the following input:

            ' UNION SELECT @@version--
    This might return the following output. 
    In this case, you can confirm that the database is Microsoft SQL Server and see the version used:

            Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (SP2) (KB4052908) - 13.0.5026.0 (X64)
            Mar 18 2018 09:11:49
            Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation
            Standard Edition (64-bit) on Windows Server 2016 Standard 10.0 <X64> (Build 14393: ) (Hypervisor)

    sample: lab7-solution.txt




Listing the contents of the database

  Most database types (except Oracle) have a set of views called the information schema. 
  This provides information about the database.

  For example, you can query information_schema.tables to list the tables in the database:

    SELECT * FROM information_schema.tables
  This returns output like the following:

    TABLE_CATALOG  TABLE_SCHEMA  TABLE_NAME  TABLE_TYPE
    =====================================================
    MyDatabase     dbo           Products    BASE TABLE
    MyDatabase     dbo           Users       BASE TABLE
    MyDatabase     dbo           Feedback    BASE TABLE
  This output indicates that there are three tables, called Products, Users, and Feedback.

  You can then query information_schema.columns to list the columns in individual tables:

    SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'Users'
  
  This returns output like the following:

    TABLE_CATALOG  TABLE_SCHEMA  TABLE_NAME  COLUMN_NAME  DATA_TYPE
    =================================================================
    MyDatabase     dbo           Users       UserId       int
    MyDatabase     dbo           Users       Username     varchar
    MyDatabase     dbo           Users       Password     varchar
    
  This output shows the columns in the specified table and the data type of each column.
  sample: lab8-solution.txt
  

Blind SQL injection

What is blind SQL injection?

    Blind SQL injection occurs when an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, but its HTTP responses do not contain the results of the relevant SQL query or the details of any database errors.

    Many techniques such as UNION attacks are not effective with blind SQL injection vulnerabilities. 
    This is because they rely on being able to see the results of the injected query within the application's responses. 
    It is still possible to exploit blind SQL injection to access unauthorized data, but different techniques must be used.


Exploiting blind SQL injection by triggering conditional responses
    Consider an application that uses tracking cookies to gather analytics about usage. 
    Requests to the application include a cookie header like this:

        Cookie: TrackingId=u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4

    When a request containing a TrackingId cookie is processed, the application uses a SQL query to determine whether this is a known user:

    SELECT TrackingId FROM TrackedUsers WHERE TrackingId = 'u5YD3PapBcR4lN3e7Tj4'
    This query is vulnerable to SQL injection, but the results from the query are not returned to the user. 
    However, the application does behave differently depending on whether the query returns any data. 
    If you submit a recognized TrackingId, the query returns data and you receive a "Welcome back" message in the response.

    This behavior is enough to be able to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability. 
    You can retrieve information by triggering different responses conditionally, depending on an injected condition.


    To understand how this exploit works, suppose that two requests are sent containing the following TrackingId cookie values in turn:

        …xyz' AND '1'='1
        …xyz' AND '1'='2

    The first of these values causes the query to return results, because the injected AND '1'='1 condition is true. 
    As a result, the "Welcome back" message is displayed.
    The second value causes the query to not return any results, because the injected condition is false. 
    The "Welcome back" message is not displayed.
    This allows us to determine the answer to any single injected condition, and extract data one piece at a time.
