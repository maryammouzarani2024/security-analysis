Lab #2: Clickjacking with form input data prefilled from a URL parameter

Target: Change an email address

This lab extends the basic clickjacking example in Lab: Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection.
The goal of the lab is to change the email address of the user by prepopulating a form using a URL parameter and enticing the user to inadvertently click on an "Update email" button.

Hint: 
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into updating their email address by clicking on a "Click me" decoy. 
    The lab is solved when the email address is changed.
    You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter



Analysis:

  In my-account page there is a update email button and a form with csrf token to update an email. 
  Note that this page recieves also the new email address as the get parameters. 
  So it is possible to decieve the victim to change his address into what we want.

  This csrf protection vulnerability might exist in other web applications, every thing is checked but the user is redirected into a payment page with get parameters and
  no csrf control.

  solution:

  <style>

        z-index: 2;
    }
    div {
        position:absolute;
