Lab #2: Clickjacking with a frame buster script

Target: Change an email address

This lab is protected by a frame buster which prevents the website from being framed. 
Can you get around the frame buster and conduct a clickjacking attack that changes the users email address?


Hint: 
    To solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into updating their email address by clicking on a "Click me" decoy. 
    The lab is solved when the email address is changed.
