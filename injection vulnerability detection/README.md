new pathgrind, Guided Injection Vulnerability Detecting Fuzzer
=========
This is a revision of pathgrind at https://github.com/dpc-grindland/Fuzzgrind. 
In the new version a static analysis is first performed to locate hotspots, calculate the attck pattern and then, pathgrid is used to fuzz the execution paths containing these operations and calculates the path and vulnerability constraints and create appropriate input data to test the vulnerability.  

More details are available in the article "Detecting injection vulnerabilities in executable codes with concolic execution" at https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8342862 .

Requirements
------------
